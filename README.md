# Project Description

* Our group created a class attendance tracker for professors to use to track class attendance on the daily basis.
* Students can access the website by scanning the QR code on the page. They can then log in through the website to have their attendance tracked/updated on the attendance log.
* Our application tracks the student's name along with the time they signed into class. 

# Reflection

* While we are happy with our project, if we had more time, we would have implemented functionality to allow professors with multiple classes to track them all.
